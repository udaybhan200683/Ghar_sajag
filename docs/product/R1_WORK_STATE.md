# R1 Current Work State

**Updated:** 2026-10-07

## Authoritative work line
- Worktree: `/home/udaybhan/projects/Ghar_sajag_r1`
- Branch: `feature/r1-commercial-baseline`
- Current P0 product behavior and application-vs-physical evidence boundaries: `docs/product/P0_PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Closed / physically qualified

Fresh-install durability path physically proven:
- fresh native ownership/enrollment;
- Node empty-AEAD hardware-AES regression;
- Hub owner stack sizing;
- first durable event commit;
- Hub recovery without watchdog starvation;
- authenticated Node runtime/rejoin;
- Node→Hub transmission;
- ACK class 0 and retirement;
- duplicate ACK safe;
- lost-ACK/reboot/retry duplicate safety;
- final Node retained/in-flight queues empty in lost-ACK qualification.

Do not reopen unless later code/hardware changes can invalidate these gates.

## USB automation

Zero-touch USB automation is convenience tooling, not an R1 product requirement. Keep it out of the critical path while product blockers remain.

## Working-tree reconciliation — 2026-10-07

The previously uncommitted qualified Node empty-AEAD and Hub native durability,
first-commit, stack/recovery, and lost-ACK controls are now committed, along with
their focused tests and existing factory/USB tooling. The canonical storage
contract and GS-D020 Jira traceability are tracked. Existing physical evidence
is preserved unchanged; no hardware test, initialization or flash was repeated.
See [the reconciliation snapshot](../progress/R1_WORKTREE_RECONCILIATION_20261007.md)
for every initial file, commit units, validations and remaining metadata.

Seven focused C++ gates, the production PSA host regression, factory/dispatcher/
profile tests, real Hub ELF checks and USB offline mocks passed. Two optional
initializer-ELF tests were skipped because their artifact is absent. The legacy
`hub-journal-migration-host-test` fails at `clean migration commits` on both the
start commit and reconciled sources; this pre-existing legacy failure is
DEFER_POST_R1 under GS-D001, with no migration fix attempted. `validation-fast`
still includes that target and is not claimed green. Eleven Windows download
metadata streams remain untracked and untouched; no uncommitted implementation
remains. Requirements and context version `2026-10-07.001` are unchanged.

Final lost-ACK source: `docs/hw/evidence/R1_LOST_ACK_FINAL/lost-ack-2h5v9gjp/status.json`.
Selected duplicate record growth is `79 - 78 - 1 independent event = 0`; selected
Node ACK is class=0 retired=1 and final retained=0/in_flight=0. This preserves the
previous physical PASS rather than claiming a new qualification run.

## Current R1 blocker

Hub storage lifetime/data-lifecycle architecture.

The previous fresh-install durability and lost-ACK qualification remains closed. This blocker concerns lifetime behavior after continued household activity; it does not invalidate the already-passed physical proof. Do not spend journal capacity or repeat HIL to investigate the design.

Known requirements:
- current finite append-only journal lifetime is unacceptable;
- reducer/routine state must be durably materialized/bounded;
- exact dedupe retained until retirement semantics safely cover it;
- backend outbox separated logically from local correctness;
- cloud-connected Hub pushes near-real-time;
- PWA reads already-current backend data;
- cloud outage does not stop local safety/routine learning;
- repetitive raw sensor detail can be coalesced;
- design must first fit the existing 4 MB Hub;
- exact retention/offline-capacity numbers are not yet locked.

## Initial storage architecture checkpoint (historical proposal)

Architecture analysis at storage-worktree baseline
`cd8d126ab44689cc9c6ebbbe74e6dce058d4323b` is recorded in
[R1_HUB_STORAGE_DATA_LIFECYCLE.md](../exec-plans/active/R1_HUB_STORAGE_DATA_LIFECYCLE.md).
It recommends a **conditional** 384 KiB lifecycle allocation with dual OTA,
not an approved partition change. Current secure target uses the durability
owner/slot adapter and persisted receipts/reports, but retains 128 immutable
events. The 192 simultaneous Node-pending-key bound does not bound accumulated
ACKed-but-unreported Hub evidence without a report/admission window.

Implementation remains STOP pending product outage/overflow decisions, bounded
retirement progress, reducer/model limits, backend summary/effect completion,
safe rollback/format transition, current image fit and crash/wear proof.
Historical build sizes do not establish current-baseline OTA margin.
Existing physical qualification and deferred legacy migration classification
are unchanged; no firmware, physical event or new qualification was performed.

Subsequent efficiency phase preserves that architecture as documentation commit
`94fe1a8` and implements **isolated host-only policy-neutral primitives** under
the code project's `host/storage/`, with dedicated tests and benchmarks. No
production target lists or ACK path are changed. The optimized candidate shares
one immutable event across lifecycle owners; existing 128 KiB feasibility is
**CONDITIONAL**, so partition enlargement remains UNDECIDED rather than assumed.
The current 128-event production limit is unchanged. One million simulated events
show fixed 192-record storage and allocation-free primitives; existing journal
and backend completion host regressions pass. These are host results, not
physical durability/GC/rollback qualification. See ExecPlan section 20 and its
host evidence for exact byte budgets, benchmark scope and remaining STOP gates.

Derive and close the storage/data-lifecycle design for the existing 4 MB Hub and six-Node worst case before implementation. Separate:

1. active correctness journal and dedupe state;
2. materialized routine/reducer state;
3. backend outbox and completion semantics;
4. short local history/cache and safe reclamation;
5. offline capacity and six-Node worst-case event rates;
6. flash wear, crash-safe cleanup reserve and OTA budget.

Do not implement a guessed retention policy or merely increase the 128-event constant. Exact retention/offline-capacity numbers and partition-layout changes remain open decisions. See `docs/architecture/STORAGE_SYNC_ROUTINE_LEARNING.md` and `docs/product/DECISION_LOG.md`.

## BAT-C8

GS-D020 traceability: GS-114 — implementation/focused qualification; GS-146 — final R1 battery closure. Issue completion is not inferred from this mapping.

BAT-C8 is an R1-required feature with physical qualification pending (GS-D020). Physical cases P1–P10 remain NOT_RUN; these are test case IDs, not priority labels. Required production proof covers sleep entry, GPIO/timer wake, bounded resume, sensing/runtime and radio restoration, safe fail-awake behavior, and event-processing regression. Do not block on final battery-life optimization or long-duration endurance absent an explicit R1 battery-life claim. No BAT-C8 tests were run as part of the documentation decision.

## Stop rule

If work does not fix an R1 blocker or implement a locked R1 requirement, strongly consider backlog.

## Storage-first requirement checkpoint — 2026-10-07

Qualified isolated core checkpoint: `45f6b00`; million-event bounded fixture re-run PASS. GS-D021/022/023 now lock storage/retrieval-before-CPU priority and failure-aware routine/daily recovery with NO_ACTIVITY distinct from NO_OBSERVATION. Context revision advances from `2026-10-07.001` to `2026-10-07.002`. No production integration or partition approval. Existing primitive evidence does not prove daily finalization, retirement progress, AEAD GC or rollback. Current 128 KiB feasibility remains CONDITIONAL pending those proofs and product/backend limits.

At the GS-D021/022/023 checkpoint, the designated canonical branch still had `.001`; that storage-worktree requirement commit required review/promotion by an explicitly authorized canonical-source action. The density run subsequently started with local/canonical `.002` PASS. Do not silently synchronize worktrees or bypass the context guard. Next step: align approved canonical context, then implement policy-neutral failure models and close time/coverage, backend aggregate revisions, retirement-credit and COW recovery proofs before production work.

Refinement design is in ExecPlan section21: one shared immutable body, conditional derived-nonce84/104-byte records, coverage-aware320-byte daily aggregates,6,144-byte checkpoint candidate, exact128 KiB reservation arithmetic and Node/Hub/backend/day/reclaim failure matrices. No final record size or retention promise is approved. Conservative normal incremental detail capacity is76 records (4.75 hours at384/day);72-hour comparison needs249,856 bytes under the stated worst-record independent-reserve allocation, not a new requirement. Critical reserve8,192 protects one bounded32-record burst only; it does not solve indefinite critical saturation. The finite384 exact-key induction requires persisted admission credits/report progress; production bound remains unproven.

Unchanged core million-event and ASan/UBSan checks, journal/full129 recovery and backend completion regressions, and24 retirement-model tests pass; static byte arithmetic/relative paths and diff checks pass. New coverage/day/reclaim failure models are specified but not implemented: canonical requirement commit must precede dependent implementation, and the new local version must pass the context guard against the designated canonical source first. No hardware result, production integration, CSV change, BAT-C8 or Jira action.

Current no-HIL Hub target build now PASS after explicit C3 artifact build: actual Hub.bin1,864,624 B; current1,966,080-byte slots leave101,456 B. Static DRAM45,783 B/IRAM87,359 B are linker figures, not runtime heap margins. The old384 KiB candidate fails image fit by29,616 B;256 KiB leaves only35,920 B before future code/reserve. No partition resize approved. Build/test provenance: [refinement evidence](../exec-plans/evidence/R1_STORAGE_FIRST_REFINEMENT_20261007.md).

## Storage-density closeout — current handoff, 2026-10-07

Host-only codec/tests/benchmark/evidence commit: `74c4b99`. Initial resume
preflight PASS at local/canonical2026-10-07.002. Existing files and all evidence
were preserved; no expensive passed tests were repeated. Final density
million-event PASS (peak192 keys, fixed storage/RAM, portable hot new0),
ASan/UBSan terminal PASS and current storage/backend/journal regressions
are preserved. Sanitizer exit-status session handle was lost on interruption;
its completed temporary output is byte-identical to the tracked PASS log.
No LeakSanitizer or physical result is claimed.81-field inventory and
static budgets/links/diff checks passed; CSV cells were preserved during
line-ending normalization. Only the missing fast one-day size comparison
was completed with the unchanged codec.

[ExecPlan sections22.10/22.11](../exec-plans/active/R1_HUB_STORAGE_DATA_LIFECYCLE.md)
and [density evidence](../exec-plans/evidence/R1_STORAGE_ENCODING_DENSITY_20261007.md)
supersede earlier density recommendations for current planning while
preserving historical/numeric-only comparisons. Full self-contained identity
and config context costs728 B sample /1370 B maximum per independently
restartable4 KiB sector; serializers/security integration are PROPOSED.
Timing-variation median body13/HOT36/WARM15–16 B excludes shared header/tail;
maxima raw101/HOT124/WARM103 B. Conditional fixed100 KiB +variable28 KiB
reservation fits the existing partition arithmetically, not by allocator proof.

Full-source timing-variation retention: NORMAL1281 sample /1056 max-name
records (80.0625/66 hours), HIGH1347/1103, STRESS1457/1181. Synthetic72h
NORMAL plus daily/fixed reserve requires131072 B sample (zero spare),
135168 B maximum (4096 deficit).128 KiB remains CONDITIONAL; no approved
72-hour guarantee or proven partition enlargement requirement. The conservative
prior76-record result and narrower uniform-numeric1595 result use different
representations/reservations and are not production guarantees. Current
1864624-byte image and101456-byte OTA margin remain prior build evidence.

GS-D024 now locks redundancy elimination and compact bounded context/restart
evaluation before storage enlargement. Context advances.002 ->.003, separately
from host work. Designated canonical remains.002; final preflight is expected
STALE and all substantive work must STOP then. No automatic synchronization
or promotion. Next step is explicitly authorized canonical review/promotion
and preflight PASS, followed by policy-neutral authenticated allocator/root/
nonce/reclaim and full dictionary/config recovery proofs. Also close retirement
credit/report bound, exact witness retry projection, offline/saturation policy,
backend daily/effect/revision/substitution, coverage/trusted-time/day recovery,
rollback and target RAM/wear/OTA growth before production integration.

Production integration NO; partition CSV/ACK/backend/PWA unchanged; hardware
unused; BAT-C8/Jira untouched. Existing physical fresh-install gates stay closed.


## 2026-10-07 lifecycle proof checkpoint (context .003)

Canonical promotion is complete; storage preflight PASS at2026-10-07.003.
The [focused lifecycle evidence](../exec-plans/evidence/R1_STORAGE_RETIREMENT_RECLAIM_PROOF_20261007.md)
and ExecPlan section23 preserve the new host-only findings. Node pending192 is
source-proven; historical Hub exact evidence has no finite current protocol
progress bound when event ACKs succeed and reports are lost. A proposed32-credit
per-owner gate gives384 live witnesses in a fixed host model, not production.
4,325 abstract COW cuts, million-event bounded run, sanitizers and relevant
existing regressions PASS. Full authenticated allocator/root/nonce/erase/rollback
and credit durability/fairness/critical policy remain OPEN. No hardware used.

A conditional53-byte dedupe-only witness raw ledger frees one sector: fixed
98,304 +shared32,768 =131,072. Synthetic72h NORMAL sample/max raw sizes
126,976/131,072 B; NVS pool tax and simultaneous192-body worst case prevent
a production guarantee.128 KiB remains CONDITIONAL; enlargement not proven
necessary. Native retry digest includes Hub receive time; outer journal key-only
duplicate bypass versus component digest checking needs end-to-end investigation.
Next close progress/admission and authenticated peak allocator proofs, then
explicit backend/offline/critical decisions; do not production-integrate.
No new locked requirement or CONTEXT_VERSION change.
